What is honest right now
- QA has the deepest market coverage because several scanners were built QA-first.
- Non-QA packs currently rely on generic public job feeds and LinkedIn/HN, not on Upwork/Workana/Freelancermap specialization.
- The bot can offer profession choice only for packs that have real scanner coverage behind them.

What is not honest yet
- Claiming full parity across all professions.
- Claiming that Upwork, Telegram gigs, Workana, and Freelancermap are already generalized for software/data/security/devops.

Next expansion targets
- Public ATS boards: Workable, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Teamtailor, Recruitee
- Startup -> ATS chain for profession packs
- Generalized Reddit/Telegram/Upwork scanners beyond QA-first heuristics
