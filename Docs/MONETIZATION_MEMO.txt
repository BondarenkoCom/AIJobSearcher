AIJobSearcher monetization memo
Date: 2026-03-01

Goal
- Stop thinking about "job search tool" as the product.
- Treat the system as a lead engine that can be packaged into paid offers.
- Keep only directions that can realistically bring money.

What we take first
1. Telegram
- Best first money channel.
- Good for paid lead feed, subscription, or pay-per-drop.
- Fits the current project because Telegram notifications and Telegram lead scanning already exist.

2. Poe
- Best platform if we want "publish bot and platform monetizes usage/messages".
- Good as a second distribution layer after Telegram.

3. Nevermined
- Keep as later infra/agent marketplace play.
- Useful after we have a proven offer and stable backend/API.

What we do NOT prioritize now
- LINE
  Too Japan-specific operationally.
- WeChat
  Too much friction, compliance, and account complexity.
- OpenAI GPT Store
  Weak monetization path for us right now.
- TikTok Minis
  Bad fit for this product right now.
- Random marketplaces without built-in monetization
  Low leverage.

Bot brand
- Remote Work Hunter
- Meaning: one global bot brand for jobs, gigs, and contract leads.
- Profession packs can live inside the same bot later.

First sellable offer
- QA Gig Hunter
- Meaning: daily shortlist of paid QA / test automation / Playwright / Selenium / API testing gigs.
- This is the clearest first product because the repo already has relevant scanners.

Second possible offer
- Remote Job Hunter
- Meaning: remote QA jobs for longer-term roles.
- Keep as secondary product, not first.

Scanners we keep in the money stack
- Telegram gigs
- Upwork
- Workana
- Freelancermap
- LinkedIn posts
- Reddit
- gig_hunt_select as final shortlist layer

Scanners we do not make central
- Generic API job boards as the main product
- ATS / startup scans
- Broad long-term hiring scans
- Niche scans unless they directly prove money

Current product logic
- One engine, multiple offers.
- The bot can be repackaged for other work types without rewriting the whole system.
- We mainly change:
  - offer definition
  - source mix
  - filters
  - keywords
  - output format

How to retarget later
- QA Gig Hunter
- Remote Job Hunter
- Automation Client Hunter
- Bug Fix Lead Hunter
- Lead Scout for outbound agencies

What was added to support this
- config/offers.yaml
  Offer definitions.
- scripts/run_offer_pipeline.py
  One-command runner for a chosen offer.
- scripts/export_offer_feed.py
  Builds a sellable JSON/Markdown feed.
- src/offer_profiles.py
  Loads offer profiles cleanly.

Useful commands
- Run first product:
  python scripts/run_offer_pipeline.py --offer qa_gig_hunter

- Export only:
  python scripts/run_offer_pipeline.py --offer qa_gig_hunter --export-only

- Include optional login/session scanners:
  python scripts/run_offer_pipeline.py --offer qa_gig_hunter --with-optional

What to google next
- Telegram Stars bot subscriptions
- Poe creator monetization
- Nevermined agent monetization
- Telegram paid channel / paid bot examples
- Poe bot distribution
- usage-based AI agent marketplaces

Practical decision
- Build and test around Telegram first.
- Use Poe as the second publication channel.
- Keep Nevermined as phase 2 after first demand signal.
