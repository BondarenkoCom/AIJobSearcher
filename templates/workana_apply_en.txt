Hi,

I am interested in your project "{job_title}".
I am a QA Engineer with 5+ years of experience in manual and automation testing, API testing (REST/GraphQL), and C#/.NET automation (NUnit/RestSharp), including CI-based regression pipelines.

Why I fit:
- Strong QA strategy: exploratory, regression, release verification
- API and security-focused testing (auth/session/data isolation risks)
- Practical automation and clear, reproducible bug reports

I can start quickly and communicate in English.
