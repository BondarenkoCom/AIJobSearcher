Subject: QA Automation Engineer - Open Application

Hi {contact_name_or_team},

I'm reaching out with an open application for a QA Engineer / QA Automation role at {company}. I have 5+ years in QA (manual + automation), strong API testing, and C#/.NET automation experience.

I'm particularly interested in product-focused startups, especially teams building AI-powered products, where quality and fast, safe releases matter. In my current role, I also built an AI-assisted bug reporting pipeline that generates structured Jira tickets from QA notes/artifacts via Jira API (with Telegram notifications).

Key match:
- API and auth testing (REST/GraphQL)
- Automation in C#/.NET (NUnit, RestSharp)
- AI-assisted QA tooling (Jira ticket generation from QA notes/artifacts)
- CI pipelines and release verification

Resume attached. {work_preference} I can start immediately.

Best regards,
